sbt-cake is an sbt plugin for use in all projects at Cake Solutions.

It defines base settings for continuous integration and continuous
deploy automation, coding standard enforcement and library versioning
so that every team doesn't have to start from scratch and so we can
share knowledge when performing upgrades.
